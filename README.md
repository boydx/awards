## Introduction

The Undergraduate Committee (UGC) is responsible for numerous award and funding opportunities. The most significant awards are given during the annual Geography in the Bluegrass (GiB) event. The UGC is also responsible for the Undergraduate Enrichment Fund, which provides funding for undergraduate research.

The main goals of these opportunities are to support our undergraduates and to promote the department's recruitment of new students. This task requires the cooperation of the entire department. The following timeline is recommended:

* At the beginning of the semester, instructors should present these opportunities to their students. A boilerplate slideshow should be made available to instructors.
* Nominations open immediately after Spring Break. Another slideshow should be made available to instructors.
* Nominations close two weeks before the GiB event. Late submissions should be allowed but not encouraged.
* The UGC meets to determine the winners one week before the GiB event. The UGC Chair determines how the submissions are juried with the understanding that UGC supports all students. All winning submissions should be archived.
* During the GiB event, quality photographs should be taken of the award winners. These photographs should be archived.
* After the GiB event, the UGC Chair should send a congratulatory email to the winners. The email should include a link to the archived photographs and a recommendation that the winners add the award to their CVs with a provided citation.

Recommendation: Create a release form the winners can sign to allow the department to use their photographs and content in promotional materials.

## Undergraduate GiB awards 

The UGC is responsible for six awards presented at the annual GiB event. The Schwendeman award is based on GPA. The remaining five awards are based on nominations and are juried by the UGC. Award presentations at the GiB event are made by the UGC Chair and DUS.

The UGC Chair has wide discretion in administering the awarding process. It is recommended that these guidelines be followed:

* Students can self-nominate, except for the Raitz and Geoghegan awards.
* Students can only receive two awards per year. Therefore, they should only be nominated for two awards. If a student does receive more than two nominations and wins, the UGC Chair should determine which award(s) the student will receive.
* Except for the Schwendeman Award, students can not be win the same award in consecutive years.
* Co-authored works can be nominated for awards, but the submission must be accompanied by written approval from each author. If a co-author is eligible for the award, they should be nominated. Any cash award will be split(?) between the nominated authors.
 
### 🏆 The Joseph R. Schwendeman Award
    
This award is determined by a student's GPA. Student must be a declared geography major with at least 60 hours of undergraduate course work and 18 hours in geography course credits. This award will be presented to the student with the highest grade point average for overall coursework as determined by Arts and Sciences or Registrar's records. In case of a tie, the award will go the student with the highest GPA in geography courses. The student's name will be engraved on a special plaque that is displayed in the departmental office. Named for the Department's first Chairperson.

This award is presented to the junior or senior Geography major to support academic merit and diversity among undergraduate students in the department. This recognition includes a cash award.

### 🏆 Outstanding Undergraduate Research Paper Award 

Student must be a declared geography major with at least 60 hours of undergraduate course work. Research papers prepared for geography courses or presented at regional or national professional meetings are eligible for consideration. The quality of the research problem and the writing and presentation of findings are the principal criteria used in making the award. This includes originality and relevance of the work, and professional potential as indicted by the project. This recognition includes a cash award. Formerly the Ellen Churchill Semple Award.
 
### 🏆 Gyula Pauer Cartography Project Award 

Student must be a declared geography major with at least 60 hours of undergraduate course work. Students who wish to be considered for this award should assemble a portfolio of maps prepared in conjunction with any geography class, appropriate internship, or independent study courses they have taken. The quality of work submitted is the principal criterion used in making the award. This means overall quality, indications of technical maturity, and an indication of potential as a professional. This recognition will include a cash award. Named for the Department’s first Cartography Lab Director.

### 🏆 Withington Human/Cultural Geography Award

This award recognizes outstanding student writing in topics following the traditional cultural/behavioral theme in geography. This award, which may be awarded at each of the Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral levels, recognizes outstanding student writing in topics following the traditional cultural/behavioral theme in geography.

Recommendation: Clarify if three awards can be given (UG, MA, PhD) in one year. Also, clarify if the UGC is responsible for the MA and PhD awards.

### 🏆 Thomas M. Geoghegan Award

This award recognizes the sophomore or junior Geography major for exceptional dedication and spirit to undergraduate studies in geography.


## TA & instructor GiB awards

These awards are determined by the undergraduate majors. In previous years, the majors met in a group called the UK Geographical Society (or Society of Geographers?) and voted on these awards.  Award presentations at the GiB event are made by the Chair.

Recommendation: in lieu of a student group, the UGC should provision an online form for student voting. Results of this vote are sent to the Department Chair.

### 🏆 Outstanding Geography Teacher Award

These awards are presented to the geography faculty (and any full-time or part-time instructor) and teaching assistant who has shown outstanding teaching ability. 

## Undergraduate Enrichment Fund

Established in honor of the Department’s 75th Anniversary

The Undergraduate Enrichment Fund, administered by the Department of Geography Undergraduate
Committee (UGC), was established in 2019 in commemoration of the Department’s 75th anniversary. 
Its purpose is to provide financial support to outstanding undergraduate students seeking
professionalization as geographers through experiential learning beyond the classroom. It is intended to
provide financial support to undergraduates engaging in geographic research or pursuing internships in
for which funding is essential to be able to effectuate that work. Some examples of enrichment
activities might include professional internships which may be unpaid or do not qualify for GEO 399
academic credit, independent research, or research in support of a geography professor or geography
doctoral student. This fund will help undergraduate students mature their skills to be more competitive
for graduate programs and/or professional employment after completion of their undergraduate
degree.  These funds are also eligible for use as cash awards for professional and ac academic
competitions within the Department and University.

* Are full-time University of Kentucky undergraduate students, with a declared major or minor in
Geography, Mapping &amp; GIS, or Urban Studies.
* Have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher, or petition by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS).
* Have completed at least 60 hours toward the Bachelors’ degree, and at least 12 hours in Geography
at the University of Kentucky, or petition by the DUS.
 
### Scholarship

statement of purpose for the proposed activity (research, internship, etc.), a scope of work, proposed
budget and justification of funds, and a schedule for completion. Students who request support from the UEF must discuss how the proposed activity serves to enhance their undergraduate education and
professionalization in geography. The UGC shall review applications on a rolling basis.

Remuneration shall be disbursed on a monthly basis, pending completion of tasks as outlined in the
statement of purpose and schedule. If funding is necessary to start up the enrichment activity, this must
be articulated in the application. If seeking funds to support research, applicants must have
documentation by the supporting faculty sponsor, as well as a list of tasks to be completed.   The letter
may not exceed one page in length. Application letters may be submitted at any time, however the UGC
recommends that applications be submitted at least two months prior to the start of the enrichment
activity. 

### Awards for promotional events
